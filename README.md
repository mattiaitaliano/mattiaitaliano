I am **Mattia Italiano**, and as you can tell from my surname, I'm an Italian  fellow born in Rome who immigrated to the sunny Great Britain. I lived in London for a while before I decided to move in Nottingham (which it feels like I've merely changed rooms thanks to the work from home).

I'm - in order - a father, an husband ad a geek that tries to mix his passion about coding with the financial one. I'm currently diving into Data Science 📊 and Sofware Engineering 🧑‍💻
